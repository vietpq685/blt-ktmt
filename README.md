# 8086 Assembly Emulator

This project is an emulator built with Python and Tkinter that simulates the execution of 8086 assembly instructions. It supports basic arithmetic and logical operations, providing a graphical interface to interact with the emulator.

## Features

- Supports running the following instructions in 8086 assembly code:
  - `MOVE` – Move data between registers or memory
  - `ADD` – Add two values
  - `SUB` – Subtract one value from another
  - `INC` – Increment a value by 1
  - `DEC` – Decrement a value by 1
  - `MUL` – Multiply two values
  - `DIV` – Divide one value by another
